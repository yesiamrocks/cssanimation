#### Option A: Install with NPM

```shell
npm i cssanimationio
```

Import it into your file:

```shell
`import 'cssanimation.css';`
```

#### Option B: Install via CDN

Include the `cssanimation.css` library into the `<head>`:

```html
<head>
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/cssanimationio/dist/cssanimation.css"
  />
</head>
```

## Usage Examples

After installing `cssanimation.css` library, now add the class `.cssanimation` and the class of animation name like `.fadeIn` for fade in animation to an element. For list of animation class name [click here](cssanimation-cheatsheet.md) or [check the website](https://cssanimation.io/getting-started.html).

```html
<h1 class="cssanimation fadeIn">Hello, World!</h1>
```

_That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super!_

## How to Use Letter Animations

Animate your text one letter at a time with style. Our library includes **two exclusive types** of letter animations: `sequence` and `random`.

What Are Sequence and Random Animations?

- **`sequence`** ‚Äì Letters animate **one after another**, in order.
- **`random`** ‚Äì Letters animate in a **randomized order**, adding playful motion.

#### Step 1. Include the Script

Add this right **before the closing `</body>` tag**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yesiamrocks/cssanimation.io@latest/letteranimation.min.js"></script>
```

#### Step 2. Add Animation classes to Your HTML

Use:

| Class          | What It Does                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `cssanimation` | Base class for all animations                   |
| `leFadeIn`     | A letter animation class (Fades in each letter) |
| `sequence`     | Animates letters in order                       |
| `random`       | Animates letters in random order                |

```html
<h1 class="cssanimation leFadeIn sequence">Hello World</h1>
<h2 class="cssanimation leFadeIn random">Surprise!</h2>
```

> This feature is **exclusive to cssanimation.io** ‚Äî making it perfect for creative headlines, banners, parallax effect, hero sections, and expressive UI storytelling.

## Modular Import

Only need fade and zoom?

```html
<link href="cssanimation.io/src/fade.css" rel="stylesheet" />
<link href="cssanimation.io/src/zoom.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

# ![GSAP Powered](https://img.shields.io/badge/GSAP-Powered-brightgreen) GSAP Animation Guide

cssanimation.io isn‚Äôt just about CSS ‚Äì it also supports **GSAP** (GreenSock Animation Platform), the gold standard for JavaScript animations. With GSAP, you get even more powerful, smooth, and flexible control over your animations.

## Why Use the GSAP Version?

- Smoother and more performant animations.
- Fine control over timing, easing, delays, and sequencing.
- Works great with ScrollTrigger, SplitText, and other GSAP plugins.
- Ideal for creative UI/UX and motion design.

## Getting Started with GSAP Version

Here‚Äôs how to animate elements using our GSAP-powered version:

#### 1. Install via NPM

```bash
npm install cssanimationio gsap
```

Then in your JavaScript:

```js
// Import GSAP core
import { TweenMax } from "gsap";

// Import cssanimation.io's GSAP integration
import "cssanimationio/cssanimation-gsap";

// Include CSS styles
import "cssanimationio/cssanimation.css"; // or cssanimation.min.css
```

#### Or Include via CDN. If you're working without a bundler:

```html
<!-- GSAP -->
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/1.19.1/TweenMax.min.js"></script>

<!-- cssanimation.io's GSAP script -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/yesiamrocks/cssanimation.io@latest/cssanimation-gsap.js"></script>
```

### 2. Add Animation Classes to Your Elements

Add the `cssanimation` class and one of the supported animation class names, like `fadeIn`:

```html
<h1 class="cssanimation fadeIn">Example</h1>
```

üìå **Tip**: Check the full list of animation class names on the [homepage](https://cssanimation.io) or in the cheatsheet.

### 3. Letter Animations (Sequential Only)

For **letter-by-letter animation**, just use any `le*` animation class like `leFadeIn`.

```html
<h1 class="cssanimation leFadeIn">Amazing!</h1>
```

_Note: The GSAP version currently supports **sequential letter animations only**. Random animation support is coming soon!_
