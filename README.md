**cssanimation** is a lightweight, modular CSS animation library built for front-end developers, creative coders, and UI ninjas.

From simple fades and zooms to dynamic letter effects and 3D transitions, we‚Äôve got your motion design needs covered.

You're in control. Just apply the [class names](https://yesiamrocks.github.io/cssanimation/cssanimation-demo.html) where you want them. **Zero setup. No JavaScript needed (unless you want GSAP). Just clean, reusable animations that "just work."**

```

#### Individual Imports (if you only need specific parts):

### Install via CDN

Quickly add **cssanimation** to your HTML. Include these lines in your `<head>`tag:

```html
<head>
  <link
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation@latest/dist/cssanimation.min.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
  <link
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation@latest/dist/cssanimation-utility.min.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</head>
```

### üß© How to Use It

Once installed, simply add the base`.cssanimation` to your element, along with your chosen animation class like `.ca__fx-FadeIn` for fade in animation.

```html
<h1 class="cssanimation ca__fx-fadeIn">cssanimation</h1>
```

_That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super! üéâ_

### Understanding Our Class Prefixes

We use clear prefixes to help you find the right animation or utility class.

| Prefix    | Description                                      | Example Usage                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `ca__fx-` | Visual FX animations (pure CSS)                  | `<h1 class="ca__fx-bounceX">`   |
| `ca__u-`  | Utility classes (pure CSS spacing, layout, etc.) | `<h1 class="ca__u-speedChill">` |

## üß∞ Utility Class

**cssanimation** also provides a powerful set of pre-built utility classes to fine-tune your animations. Use them alongside the `.cssanimation` base class and your chosen animation class.

This includes:

- `.ca__u-speed*`: Control animation speed (e.g., `.ca__u-speedChill`).
- `.ca__u-ease*`: Set easing functions (e.g., `.ca__u-easeSnappy`).
- `.ca__u-loop*`: Define repeat settings (e.g., `.ca__u-loopTriple`).
- `.ca__u-delay*`: Add animation delays (e.g., `.ca__u-delay3`).

Check out the full list and details in [`cssanimation-utilities.md`](./reference/cssanimation-reference.md#utility-classes-ungrouped).
