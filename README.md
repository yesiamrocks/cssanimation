üëâ [Live Demo](https://yesiamrocks.github.io/cssanimation/) | [Download via NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation) | [CDN jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation) | [CDN unpkg](https://app.unpkg.com/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation@6.10.1)

## Get Started: Installation

Choose the method that fits your workflow best.

#### Install via NPM

```bash
npm i @hellouxpavel/cssanimation
```

#### Or install with Yarn

```bash
yarn add @hellouxpavel/cssanimation
```

#### Import Everything (Core Library, CSS Utility Classes & Letter Animation):

```bash
import '@hellouxpavel/cssanimation';
```

#### Individual Imports (if you only need specific parts):

CSS only

```bash
// Core CSS animations
import '@hellouxpavel/cssanimation/css';

// Utility CSS classes (like speed, delay, easing)
import '@hellouxpavel/cssanimation/utility';
```

For Letter Animations (JavaScript required for this part):

```bash
//letter-by-letter, word-by-word, and line-by-line animations
import '@hellouxpavel/cssanimation/letter';
```

### Install via CDN

Quickly add **{css}animation** to your HTML. Include these lines in your `<head>`tag:

```html
<head>
  <link
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation@latest/dist/cssanimation.min.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
  <link
    href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@hellouxpavel/cssanimation@latest/dist/cssanimation-utility.min.css"
    rel="stylesheet"
  />
</head>
```

### How to Use It

Once installed, simply add the base`.cssanimation` to your element, along with your chosen animation class like `.ca__fx-FadeIn` for fade in animation.

```html
<h1 class="cssanimation ca__fx-fadeIn">cssanimation</h1>
```

_That's it! You've got a CSS animated element. Super! üéâ_

### Understanding Our Class Prefixes

We use clear prefixes to help you find the right animation or utility class.

| Prefix    | Description                                      | Example Usage                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `ca__fx-` | Visual FX animations (pure CSS)                  | `<h1 class="ca__fx-bounceX">`   |
| `ca__u-`  | Utility classes (pure CSS spacing, layout, etc.) | `<h1 class="ca__u-speedChill">` |

## Modular Import

Want to keep your CSS bundle size minimal? You can import only the **animation groups** or **individual effects** you actually use!

HTML

```html
<!-- Grouped animation (e.g., ca__BlurIn module) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./dist/modules/ca__BlurIn.css" />
```

CSS, SCSS or JavaScript (Webpack, Vite, Rollup)

```CSS
// Grouped module
@import './dist/modules/ca__BlurIn.css';
```

#### Available Modules

Check out the `./dist/modules/` folder to see all available animation groups:

| Module                  | File                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Blob Animation Group    | `./dist/modules/ca__Blob.css`    |
| Blur In Animation Group | `./dist/modules/ca__BlurIn.css`  |
| Bounce Animation Group  | `./dist/modules/ca__Bounce.css`  |
| Elastic Animation Group | `./dist/modules/ca__Elastic.css` |
| FadeIn Animation Group  | `./dist/modules/ca__FadeIn.css`  |
| ...and more             | See `./dist/modules/` folder     |

## Individual Animation Imports

Need just one animation, like `fadeIn`, `bounceX`, or `zoomIn`? You can import individual effect files too.

HTML

```html
<!-- Individual effect (e.g., fadeIn only) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./dist/animations/ca__fadeIn.css" />
```

CSS, SCSS or JavaScript (Webpack, Vite, Rollup)

```CSS
// Individual effect
@import './dist/animations/ca__fadeIn.css';
```

#### Available Individual Effects

Each file in the `./dist/animations/` folder is a standalone animation with scoped styles and keyframes. Explore and import only what you need!

## Utility Class

**{css}animation** also provides a powerful set of pre-built utility classes to fine-tune your animations. Use them alongside the `.cssanimation` base class and your chosen animation class.

This includes:

- `.ca__u-speed*`: Control animation speed (e.g., `.ca__u-speedChill`).
- `.ca__u-ease*`: Set easing functions (e.g., `.ca__u-easeSnappy`).
- `.ca__u-loop*`: Define repeat settings (e.g., `.ca__u-loopTriple`).
- `.ca__u-delay*`: Add animation delays (e.g., `.ca__u-delay3`).

Check out the full list and details in [`cssanimation-utilities.md`](./reference/cssanimation-reference.md#utility-classes-ungrouped).

### üéâ That‚Äôs It!

## Accessibility: Respecting User Preferences

By default, **{css}animation** respects user system preferences. When `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` is enabled in a user's operating system settings, animations are automatically turned off for a more comfortable user experience.
