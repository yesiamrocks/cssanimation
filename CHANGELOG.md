# Version: v2.0.3

## Release Name: Production-Ready Build – Only dist/ Published | v2.0.3

## Release Summary

This release refines the package for real-world usage and distribution by publishing only the compiled assets in the dist/ folder. It ensures consumers get exactly what they need—no build tools, no source clutter, just pure animations.

## What’s New in v2.0.3:

- dist/-only NPM package
  Reduced package size by excluding source files, configs, and dev tools — only production-ready assets are now shipped.
- Cleaned Up File Structure
  Improved maintainability by restructuring with a modular CSS build system and separating utility/animation modules.

## Optimized NPM Publish

Updated the package.json files field to explicitly include:

- dist/
- README.md
- LICENSE
